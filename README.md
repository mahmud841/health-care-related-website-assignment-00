* Bullet 1: Health services consist of medical professionals, organizations, and ancillary health care workers who provide medical care to those in need. Health services serve patients, families, communities, and populations. They cover emergency, preventative, rehabilitative, long-term, hospital, diagnostic, primary, palliative, and home care. These services are centered around making health care accessible, high quality, and patient-centered. Many different types of care and providers are necessary in order to offer successful health services.
* Bullet 2: Health services cover many different types of medical issues. Many people think of primary care, outpatient care, and emergency care when they need an illness managed or are generally not feeling well. However, there are more health services that are dedicated to certain illnesses or issues. These health services include:

-Mental health care
-Dental care
-Laboratory and diagnostic care
-Substance abuse treatment
-Preventative care
-Physical and occupational therapy
-Nutritional support
-Pharmaceutical care
-Transportation
-Prenatal care
* Bullet 3: The human body is a complex system with structures ranging from cells to organ systems and functions ranging from waste removal to protection and defense. The structures and functions are dedicated to maintaining a state of health in the body.
* Bullet 4: Your service was wonderful. I do not think I would have passed my tests without your program. My husband may also need the service in the future, and I will be back.

* Bullet 5: Diabetes insipidus is a medical condition that results in an abnormally large passage of urine usually as a result of a problem in the brain or a problem in the kidneys. The brain normally produces a hormone, called anti-diuretic hormone (ADH). This is a hormone that tells the kidneys to stop making urine. In other words, it tells the kidneys to conserve water within the body.

Well, if the brain is damaged due do something like brain surgery, then it may not make enough ADH. If it doesn't make enough ADH, the kidneys just make a ton of urine. On the other hand, the brain could be totally fine. Sometimes, the kidneys don't pay any attention to the ADH. This can occur due to a genetic disorder or due to some medications.

Lastly, please don't get diabetes insipidus confused with diabetes mellitus. They sound sort of similar, but they are not the same disease!
